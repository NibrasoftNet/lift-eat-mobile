# Contributing to Lift-Eat-Mobile

Thank you for helping to improve Lift-Eat-Mobile! Please follow these guidelines to keep the codebase consistent and healthy.

## Shared Domain Types

All canonical domain models (e.g. `Meal`, `FoodItem`, `IngredientWithUniqueId`, `Plan`, â€¦) live in **`/types/`** or are generated by **`/db/schema.*`**.

ðŸš« **Do NOT redeclare** these types inside components, pages or helpers. Instead, import them:

```ts
import { Meal } from '@/types/meal.type';
```

A custom ESLint rule `no-domain-type-redefinition` will raise an error in CI and during local development if a duplicate declaration is introduced.

Run the linter locally:

```bash
npm run lint        # or: pnpm lint / expo lint
```

## Project Coding Standards (recap)

â€¢ Components: PascalCase â€“ `CalculateCaloriesIntakeForm.tsx`
â€¢ Hooks: `use` + camelCase â€“ `useAppState.ts`
â€¢ Utils: kebab-case â€“ `calculate-calories-intake.validation.ts`
â€¢ Strict TypeScript everywhere (`.tsx` / `.ts`)
â€¢ Style via NativeWind / Tailwind classes

For full conventions, read `docs/MPC.md`.

Happy coding!
